NOTES - Things I figured out while working on this

OpenMP Task gotchas:
- Need #pragma omp single around task creation loop
- Tasks created too deep in recursion = terrible performance
- Work stealing is automatic but only helps if you create enough tasks

Parallel For issues:
- Static schedule doesn't work well - some threads finish way before others
- Dynamic schedule helps but has overhead
- Not good for irregular workloads like backtracking

Constraint propagation techniques:
- Naked singles: easiest, just fill cells with 1 candidate
- Hidden singles: look for numbers that can only go one place
- Naked pairs: took forever to implement, helps a bit
- Pointing pairs: not sure this one does much

Problems I ran into:
- Timer resolution is bad for fast puzzles
- Had to copy grid for each thread (memory intensive)
- Synchronization overhead is significant
- Easy puzzles solve so fast that parallel makes them slower

Things that surprised me:
- V2 (parallel for) actually performs WORSE with more threads
- AI Escargot puzzle has 78 backtracks but still solves pretty fast
- My optimizations work TOO well - puzzle mostly solved before backtracking

Speedup analysis:
- Easy: 0 backtracks, no speedup (overhead kills it)
- Medium: 0 backtracks, no speedup
- AI Escargot: 78 backtracks, best case for parallelization
- Platinum: 12 backtracks, mixed results

Thread scaling:
- 1 thread = baseline
- 2 threads = minimal improvement
- 4 threads = AI Escargot shows 1.0x (not losing performance at least)
- 8 threads = worse for V2, same for V1/V3

Ideas I didn't have time for:
- Test with 16x16 Sudoku (bigger problem = better speedup probably)
- GPU version with CUDA
- Better memory management (reduce copying)
- Adaptive thread count based on puzzle difficulty
- Profile to find actual bottlenecks

Lessons learned:
- Always measure, don't assume parallel = faster
- Overhead is real
- Problem size matters more than I thought
- Sometimes serial with good optimizations beats naive parallel

For the report:
- Be honest about limited speedups
- Explain WHY it's limited (overhead, problem size)
- Focus on what I learned, not just results
- Include all measurements even if not impressive
